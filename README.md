##Pneumonia Detection Model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This repository contains a deep learning model implemented with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is designed to classify X-ray images as either showing signs of pneumonia or being normal.

Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated using the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes:

X-ray images categorized into two classes: "Normal" and "Pneumonia."
Training, validation, and test sets are provided for model training and evaluation.
